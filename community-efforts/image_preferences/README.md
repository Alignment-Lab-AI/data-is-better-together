# Image Preferences Dataset

## What is it?

This is a project for the community to contribute image preferences for an open source dataset, that could be used for training and evaluating text to image models.

## How to get invovled

If you would like to contribute to the dataset, you can do so by adding preferences in the Argilla UI. You should follow the following steps:

1. Go to the [Argilla Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/data-is-better-together/image-preferences-argilla) and log in using your Hugging Face profile.
2. Rank the images that you prefer based on the annotation guidelines. You should rank images based on their aestehtic appeal, and how much they adhere to the prompt.

## How to use the dataset

## Which tools were used?

For the prompt ranking project, we used two tools to help us manage the annotation process.

- [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla): an open-source data annotation tool that we used for the prompt ranking. Argilla has the option of using Hugging Face for authentication, which makes it easier for the community to contribute.
- [distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel): a tool for creating and sythetic datasets. We used distilabel to evolve prompt and to create the image preferences dataset.
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): a platform for hosting machine learning applications and demos. We used Spaces to host the Argilla tool for prompt ranking.
